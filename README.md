# Mesmorized-Card-Game

## Description
A simple application that allows the user to play a Memory Card Puzzle Game. A user will choose their difficulty and then start a game, where they will be selecting cards and trying to find matches in order to win!
- Users can choose between different difficulty levels: Easy (4x4 Card Layout), Medium (6x6 Card Layout), Hard (8x8 Card Layout), and EXTREME (12x12 Card Layout)
- After a successfully won game, a user will have the option to enter in a 6-character name to add to a leaderboard for each specific game difficulty level

### How To Play (Detailed Instructions)
- A user will begin by selecting the difficulty level they want to play with.
- The user will then begin the game by clicking on the "Click to Begin" button
- Once a game is started, the user will have all the cards on display for about 3 to 5 seconds, so the user can try to quickly memorize the placement of the different icons.
- After the initial 3 to 5 seconds are up. All the cards will then flip over, hiding all the icons from the user.
- The user will then have the timer begin, and they can start to select two different cards to see if they can match cards together
- (if the cards match, they will be greyed out and highlighted)
- (if the cards do not match, then the cards will flip back over and allow the user to choose another set of cards)
- After a user has successfully matched all the cards with one another, they have WON the game!
- a Popup will display show the user the time they achieved and allow them to enter in a 6-character name to add to the leaderboard tied to the specific game difficulty the user was playing on.
- After the popup is closed out, it will bring the user back to the main menu screen where they can repeat the entire process again if they choose to.
